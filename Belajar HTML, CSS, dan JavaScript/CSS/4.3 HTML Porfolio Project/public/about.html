<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ruspan Kurnadi Manurung, a 20-year-old Informatics student at President University with a deep passion for 
    Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Project Management. As an aspiring technology professional, I enjoy creating 
    impactful solutions through software development, machine learning, and data analytics using tools like Python, SQL, and 
    Java. My commitment to continuous learning has also driven me to explore web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and 
    the MVC framework. Beyond technical expertise, I am a dedicated team player who values adaptability, open-mindedness, and 
    concise communication, ensuring effective collaboration in every project. <br><br>
    
    Outside academics, I am actively involved in leadership and community development. I serve as the Head of the Organization 
    of the Christian Community of Love, managing over 300 members and organizing more than 35 activities annually. Through my 
    roles, I have honed my skills in administration, event coordination, and team-building while fostering spiritual growth and 
    empathy. With a long-term vision of managing my own IT company, I strive to blend my technical and leadership abilities to 
    create innovative, people-centered solutions that make a meaningful impact.</p>
